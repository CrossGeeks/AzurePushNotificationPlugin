# https://aka.ms/yaml

# Defines that a commit to the master branch should trigger this build
trigger:
- master

# Defines that PRs against this branch should also trigger this build
pr:
- master

# The type of machine this build should run on and what software should be on it
pool:
  name: Hosted VS2017
  demands: msbuild
